Hello World! Intro repository

Hi everyone!

My name is Michael. I am a college student, I like video games, music, and coffee. Not necessarily in that order. I'm a beginner at coding and have been learning on and off for about a year now, but now I shall commit! My dream is to get into GIS, especially on the environmental side of things, and to be able to travel around the world!
